My first introduction to software development actually came from a networking class! While the site itself isn't much by itself it's a step in the right direction. This Project introduced me on concepts dealing with website design like how to format pages on html and other neat tricks. Throughout this class I will learn how to improve my skills but for now I think that this is a great start.

Improving my skill is an ongoing journey that requires dedication. I believe that a solid foundation in programming languages, algorithms, and data structures is essential, and I'm committed to practicing and refining these core concepts regularly. I plan to collaborate with peers more, seeking feedback on my code, and gaining valuable insights to help my growth.
