## My Journey

I've actually never questioned what makes a website work, much less the internet when I was young. I just thought that thats the way things were. During my journey of what comprises computer science I got to see just how broad yet how interconnected things are. While I have a tough time really grasping ideas in the field especially when it comes to coding. I still think that the idea of being able to create almost anything is a increadible power to have. 

## Future Plans

Firstly, I aim to strengthen my proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript. Additionally, I seek to deepen my knowledge of software architecture and design principles, enabling me to create scalable and maintainable systems. I would also like to futher my knowledge on new developments in the tech space like Artifical intelligence or the increasing need for cybersecurity. Furthering my knowledge on these topics will definitly help me down the road.

## What Now

A lot of concepts taught in computer science is skill not talent so to enhance my skills in software engineering, I have plan to improve by consistently practicing the concepts I learn from here on out. Collaboration is key on my way to becoming a better software engineer so I plan on becoming more open to asking questions and generally speaking more approachable. In time I believe that I will be able to be confident in my skills it will just take time.
