## The Road to Building a Stable environment

In the world of software development, which is always changing, design patterns have become key tools. They provide well-tested, standard ways to solve common software design problems. These patterns are more than just solutions; they are the best methods developed by experienced software engineers. They are important for making code well-organized, solving problems efficiently, and helping developers communicate better. This essay looks into design patterns, focusing on how they are used in JavaScript programming. Examples include module pattern, prototype pattern, singleton pattern and many more.

## A Case Study from Our Codebase

Without realizing it, our team has implemented various design patterns in our website's code. Here's a look at how these patterns have been applied:

**Component Pattern**: In developing our website, we extensively used a variety of components. This approach is vital as it involves organizing software objects into hierarchical tree structures, representing the relationship between the whole and its parts.

**Reactive Observer Pattern**: Across different components and pages of our website, we employed React's useState and useTracker hooks. This pattern enables components to automatically refresh the user interface whenever there are changes in the state, ensuring a dynamic and responsive web experience.
