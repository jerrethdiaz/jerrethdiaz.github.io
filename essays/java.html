  <h2 id="where-i-stand">Where I Stand</h2>
<p>For me personally it has been a while since I last touched any form of coding. I have been introduced to all of the major programing languages like python,C++, and javascript. However for the past year I havenâ€™t touched coding since. Getting back into the rhythm of coding is probably one of the hardest things to do, especially when you dont practice to ensure you dont lose the knowledge you learned. If I could go back in time I would definitly start a personal project to stay fresh with coding.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-is-up-there">Javascript is up There</h2>
<p>Javascript is one of the best coding languages to learn and understand. This is beacuse it allows users more flexibility to do whatever they want. Javascript allows the user to make functions that can take functions as an argument and return functions as well. The design itself is also overall more userfriendly than other languages like C++ which is a more primitive language to learn.</p>

<h2 id="wods-learn-to-love-it">WODs Learn to Love it</h2>
<p>The WOD structure I have seen used in many other classes such as calculus where there was a quiz every week on the content we learned. I personally find WODs to be stressful but in a good way. It makes us think on the concepts we learn and actually apply it. Like it was mentioned This class is about learning skills and the best way to learn is by practicing a lot. While they are stressful WODs are bound to help us improve in the end.</p>
