My first introduction to software development actually came from a networking class! While the site itself isnt much by itself it's a step in the right direction. This Project introduced me on concepts dealing with website design like how to format pages on html and other neat tricks. Throughout this class I will learn how to improve my skills but for now I think that this is a great start!
